# Live_Music_Scraper
This project is a full stack, automated event finder that consolidates the search to find local live bands. It uses Python and scraping tools to grab data from Facebook, then leverages AI to clean, organize, and store it. The final result is a simple web app that displays a single, searchable list of shows.
